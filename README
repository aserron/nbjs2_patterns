Netbeans Javascript Patterns Test.

This repo was created to help in the design of the new netbeans javascript editor.

The patterns in part pure js, other part ExtJS specific where intented to help 
the team to address problems like: 
> scope awareness
> class, instance, package differentiation (yes we emulate them, don't argue about definitions)
> module pattern paired with extension definitions (lends, constructs)
> JSDoc support
> Edge multi-inheritance situations.


Beyond this, they have little usage, you are free to look in.
